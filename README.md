# Portfolio Tracker
Hello everyone!

This project was born after I was assigned a final project for a subject at my university. The project consisted in creating an equity portfolio, at the end of the semester the person with the highest profitability would be the one with the best grade.

The first problem I encountered was that I didn't know how profitable [or not] my portfolio was, I tried to solve it in Excel, but it's almost impossible, then I decided to use Google Sheets but the spreadsheet had to import a lot of data and ended up failing. All of the above led me to try to solve the problem with Python, this GitHub project contains what is intended to be such a solution; there are still many improvements which I will introduce little by little.

When I started to develop this project I realized that I had to create a script to manage the number of assets I had. This led me to develop a CRUD system with a connection to a MySQL database. This project can be found in the other repository of my profile, at the moment I am working to make both projects work together.
